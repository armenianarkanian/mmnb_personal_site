# Personal Identity and Lived Experiences

Here are some aspects of my personal identity that I [am very open about and want to share.]

## I like rigorous adventure.

It's very common to love travel-- and I do!-- but my favorite part of adventure is the opportunity to stretch myself.
Physical challenges, learning new skills, and taking in new knowledge and understanding from museums are my favorite ways to vacation!

### I want to put a photo carousel here.

## I grew up in poverty in rural Appalachia.

This strongly shaped my identity and still affects how I walk through the world. Resources which have
helped me to understand myself and which I recommend for others include:
- [Hillbilly](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hillbilly-2018) \- A 2018 documentary about media representation of Appalachia and a look into the
experiences of some Appalachians during the lead-up to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.
- [Another Appalachia: Coming up Queer and Indian in a Mountain Place](https://wvupressonline.com/another-appalachia) \- A collection of personal
reflections in the form of creative nonfiction essays.
- [Appalachian Reckoning: A Region Responds to _Hillbilly Elegy_](https://wvupressonline.com/node/774) \- A collection of essays, poems, photo
essays and more, contributed by a wide variety of people who wished to rebut or add nuance to the concepts from the popular book _Hillbilly Elegy_. 
- [The Other America: Poverty in the United States]() \- While dated, this 1962 book detailing Michael Harrington's "rediscovery" of Appalachian
poverty was hugely influential on the War on Poverty. Additionally, I'm fascinated by the similarities between the waves of
popular interest in Appalachian poverty then and now.

### I want to put a photo carousel here.

In the summer of 2022 I had the opportunity to connect my lived experiences with my academic studies of poverty policy by conducting a small solo
research project focused on my hometown area. Though I only had a 10-week window from scoping to final edits, I'm proud of my resultant report,
[_A General Overview of the Poverty-related Challenges of Bedford County, PA_](/files/bedford_report.pdf).

## I spend a _lot_ of my free time studying
[study in a hobbyist way] [ethics, communication, emotional/relationship stuff, racial and social justice, policy]

## I'm a big ol' nerd.

I enjoy a wide variety of nerdy hobbies, such as reading sci-fi and fantasy novels, playing tabletop board and card games, playing video games and building gaming desktops.
