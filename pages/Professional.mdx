[**Supporting Students Affected by Recent FAFSA Revisions**](files/supporting_students_affected_by_FAFSA_revisions.pdf)
<br/>_(One of a team of three contributing authors; 6 week project span)_
<br/>_31 pages_

During summer 2024 I participated in the Urban Leaders Fellowship (ULF) in Oakland, CA. I worked 20 hours/week researching and designing a plan for California Volunteers
Fund to expand their Corps to Career program; I worked 15 hours/week researching policy for the Northern California College Promise Coalition (NCCPC) on the topic of 
increasing support for California students who have been negatively affected by the Better FAFSA launch; and I participated 15 hours/week in ULF professional development activities.

In spring 2024 I served the Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters as an Election Aide. I provided detail-oriented customer service in a high-pressure environment, leading voters 
through registration and voting problems that were often significantly complex

[**A General Overview of the Poverty-related Challenges of Bedford County, PA**](/files/bedford_report.pdf)
<br/>_(Solo author; 9 week project span)_
<br/>_40 pages_

My final graduate research project was a passion project of mine. In the summer of 2022, I completed an independent study wherein I
designed, carried out, and reported on research pertaining to the poverty challenges facing residents of my home county. The report explores the intersecting web
of challenges which fuel each other and effect a state of extremely limited economic mobility in this area of Northern Appalachia. Though I only had a 10-week
window from scoping to final edits, researching and writing this report allowed me to connect my lived experiences with my academic studies of poverty policy.

[**Health Equity Zones**](/files/doh_hez.pdf)
<br/>_(One of a team of four contributing authors; 6 month project span)_
<br/>_92 pages_

As part of the work to earn an MPA from the Evans school, candidates must complete a capstone project wherein they are teamed with other candidates and spend
six months working as consultants for an outside organization. My team of four had the work of researching and writing a report for the Washington State Department
of Health (WA DOH) to help prepare them to enact recently-passed legislation concerning health equity zones, or HEZ. Our work included: reporting on the demographic,
geographic, and legislative context of HEZ efforts; collecting, analyzing and reporting on community health data from all over Washington; researching and reporting on
how similar initiatives have been carried out; and distilling everything down into key takeaways for quick comprehension. 

My team collaborated splendidly and I’m very proud of our work! My areas of particular focus were to collate, analyze, and report on Washington’s community health data
and to track and report our methodology. Though we very much co-wrote and co-edited the report, Part II and Appendices B & C of the report are the sections wherein I did
most of my primary contributing work.

[**Literacy Source Community Cookbook**](/files/ls_cookbook.pdf)
<br/>_(Designer and Editor)_
<br/>_111 pages_

Though it's not a work related to policy, I'm nonetheless proud of and enthusiastic about this product, which is the result of months of collaboration between
Literacy Source students, teachers, administrators, and community members. The cookbook itself was only the final part of a long string of educational and
community endeavors, for which I was a contributing project manager. It was a privilege to assist students in sharing about their cultures, and it was a delight
to participate in the community cooking events related to this project!

I currently serve the Northern California College Promise Coalition (NCCPC) in an operations support role. I manage member data in Salesforce, write documentation for NCCPC’s operations procedures, work to carry out the org.’s emergency microgrant program, assist with event planning, and perform many other similar tasks. 

I currently work as a part-time remote college prep tutor with an excellent independent tutoring company in Seattle called
[University Tutoring](https://www.universitytutoring.com/). I've been working with University Tutoring since February of 2019 (except during the height of the pandemic),
and I deeply enjoy the puzzle of how to best convey concepts and information to learners.

My most recent policy work was a passion project of mine. In the summer of 2022 I completed an independent study wherein I
designed, carried out, and [reported on](files/bedford_report.pdf) research pertaining to the poverty challenges facing residents of my home county. 
The report explores the intersecting web of challenges which fuel each other and effect a
state of extremely limited economic mobility in this area of Northern Appalachia.

For six months in my final year of my master's degree program, I worked with a team of three other MPA (master's
of public administration) students to carry out policy analysis research and write a white paper for the Washington
State Department of Health (DOH). Focused specifically on
[the DOH's upcoming work to designate and implement Health Equity Zones (HEZ)](https://doh.wa.gov/community-and-environment/health-equity/health-equity-zones),
[our report](/files/doh_hez.pdf) includes background information, data analysis based on Washington's
community health assessments, and a breakdown of other HEZ which have been implemented in the U.S.

I worked to earn my MPA (master's of public administration) at the
[University of Washington Evans School of Public policy & Governance](https://evans.uw.edu/).
The Evans School works to provide students with a well-rounded education in quantitative
and qualitative policy and administration fields, including: _public finance; data analysis; management;
organizational performance; economics; policy analysis; and program evaluation_. During my time in the program I
also studied: _leadership; behavioral economics; qualitative research methodology; U.S. poverty policy; and Arabic
language and culture_. [My unofficial transcripts can be viewed here.](files/uw_unofficial_transcript.pdf)

Soon after moving to Seattle I began my twelve months of service as an AmeriCorps VISTA, working to build the
capacity of [a Seattle nonprofit school for English language learners called Literacy Source](https://www.literacysource.org/). During this time I honed
my project management and community liaison skills, and also developed skills in social media representation and
event planning. One of the larger, more continuous projects I co-managed resulted in the production and sale of a
community cookbook.

While living in California for the first time and briefly (in a remote capacity) after moving to Seattle, I worked for a
company called Edventure More, or EDMO. In the summers I served as a full-time instructor at their educational
youth camps. During the rest of the year I worked part time, discharging marketing duties and instructing for
community events and after-school programs. During the school years in this period I also worked sporadically as a
substitute teacher for the Cupertino Union School District.

After moving to California, I volunteered for a year as a
[court appointed special advocate, or CASA, in Santa Clara County, CA](https://childadvocatessv.org/).
In this role I was matched with kids who were involved with the Santa Clara County foster care
system, and served them as a mentor and advocate.

After college I worked as an in-home caregiver for a Pittsburgh company called Advanced Living Options, or ALO.
In my role, I supported and managed care for individuals with mental and physical disabilities. I grew up very
closely with a family member with severe special needs, which helped to prepare me for this position. Even so, this
was very intense work, and it added a lot to my knowledge and competence with navigating systemic and
individual-level challenges, government support programs, and bureaucratic regulations.

I worked for one summer as a marketing intern with a Pittsburgh property management company called Mozart
Management. It was fairly simple website management work and advertisement upkeep.

I briefly worked as a STEM coordinator with a Pittsburgh nonprofit called Neighborhood Learning Alliance, or NLA.
In this position, I gained experience designing and implementing programs in low-income schools, cultivating client and partner
relationships, and applying for grants.

After the particle detector project concluded, I worked as a nanny and tutor for College Nannies & Tutors of North
Pittsburgh. I traveled to people's homes to teach standardized test prep, STEM subjects, and some German, or to
provide childcare for younger children.

Later in my college career I worked as a lab technician with the CMU Medium Energy Physics Department. I
worked in a clean room on a small team, building a 12 GeV particle detector which was eventually installed in
[Hall D of Jefferson Lab](https://www.jlab.org/Hall-D/).

For the first few years of college, I worked as customer service associate or "desk service attendant" for my
university's Resident Services. I crewed the desks at the entrances of residence halls, checking in guests and
answering questions.

I attended [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/) for my undergraduate education. I spent the first few years pursuing
dual degrees in physics and international relations & politics; however, after working in a lab and realizing that the
day-to-day reality of work with a B.S. in physics was not what I wanted to do indefinitely, I decided to content
myself with what I already had completed in the physics track (more than a minor but less than a major) and
wraped up my B.S. in international relations & politics.

For two summers-- following my high school graduation and my freshman year of college-- I worked full time as a
secretary at the highschool in my hometown. The position was actually part of a suite of poverty-alleviation efforts
for young people from low-income families; it paid slightly above minimum wage and included some career
development support.

Soon after getting my driver's license when I was 16, I got my first job as a cashier at the McDonald's in a
neighboring town. My managers had me do front-facing work for 100% of my hours, due to my knack for customer
service.
