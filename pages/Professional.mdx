[**A General Overview of the Poverty-related Challenges of Bedford County, PA**](/files/bedford_report.pdf)
<br/>_(Solo author)_
<br/>_40 pages_

This is my most recent policy work and it was a passion project of mine. In the summer of 2022, I was able to carry out an independent study wherein I
designed and executed research and wrote a report on the poverty challenges facing residents of my home county. The report explores the intersecting web
of challenges which fuel each other and effect a state of extremely limited economic mobility in this area of Northern Appalachia. Though I only had a 10-week
window from scoping to final edits, researching and writing this report allowed me to connect my lived experiences with my academic studies of poverty policy.

[**Health Equity Zones**](/files/doh_hez.pdf)
<br/>_(One of a team of four contributing authors)_
<br/>_92 pages_

As part of the work to earn an MPA from the Evans school, candidates must complete a capstone project wherein they are teamed with other candidates and spend
six months working as consultants for an outside organization. My team of four had the work of researching and writing a report for the Washington State Department
of Health (WA DOH) to help prepare them to enact recently-passed legislation concerning health equity zones, or HEZ. Our work included: reporting on the demographic,
geographic and legislative context of HEZ efforts; collecting, analyzing and reporting on community health data from all over Washington; researching and reporting on
how similar initiatives have been carried out; and distilling everything down into key takeaways for quick comprehension. 

My team collaborated splendidly and I’m very proud of our work! My areas of particular focus were to collate, analyze and report on Washington’s community health data
and track and report our methodology. Though we very much co-wrote and co-edited the report, Part II and Appendices B & C of the report are the sections wherein I did
most of my primary contributing work.

[**Literacy Source Community Cookbook**]()
_(Designer and Editor)_
_111 pages_

Though it's not a work related to policy, I'm nonetheless proud of and enthusiastic about this product, which is the result of months of collaboration between
Literacy Source students, teachers, administrators, and community members. The cookbook itself was only the final part of a long string of educational and
community endeavors, for which I was a contributing project manager.It was a privelege to assist students in sharing about their cultures, and it was a delight
to participate in the community cooking events related to this project!

| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feb. 2019 to Now | I currently work as a part-time remote college prep tutor with an excellent independent tutoring company in Seattle called [University Tutoring](https://www.universitytutoring.com/). I've been working with University Tutoring since February of 2019 (except during the height of the pandemic), and I deeply enjoy the puzzle of how to best convey concepts and information to learners. |
| Summer 2022 | My most recent policy work was a passion project of mine. In the summer of 2022 I was able to carry out an independent study wherein I designed and executed research and [wrote a report](files/bedford_report.pdf) on the poverty challenges which face my home county. The report explores the intersecting web of challenges which fuel each other and effect a state of extremely limited economic mobility in this area of Northern Appalachia. |
| December 2022 to May 2023 | For six months in my final year of my master's degree program, I worked with a team of three other MPA (master's of public administration) students to carry out policy analysis research and write a white paper for the Washington State Department of Health (DOH). Focused specifically on [the DOH's upcoming work to designate and implement Health Equity Zones (HEZ)](https://doh.wa.gov/community-and-environment/health-equity/health-equity-zones), [our report]() includes background information, data analysis based on Washington's community health assessments, and a breakdown of other HEZ which have been implemented in the U.S. |
| Fall 2020 to Summer 2023 | I worked to earn my MPA (master's of public administration) at the [University of Washington Evans School of Public policy & Governance](https://evans.uw.edu/). The Evans School works to provide students with a well-rounded education in quantitative and qualitative policy and administration fields, including: _public finance; data analysis; management; organizational performance; economics; policy analysis; and program evaluation_. During my time in the program I also studied: _leadership; behavioral economics; qualitative research methodology; U.S. poverty policy; and Arabic language and culture_. [My unofficial transcripts can be viewed here.](files/uw_unofficial_transcript.pdf) |
| March 2019 to March 2020 | Soon after moving to Seattle I began my twelve months of service as an AmeriCorps VISTA, working to build the capacity of [a Seattle nonprofit school for English language learners called Literacy Source](https://www.literacysource.org/). During this time I honed my project management and community liaison skills, and also developed skills in social media representation and event planning. One of the larger, more continuous projects I co-managed resulted in the production and sale of a community cookbook. |
| June 2017 to Feb. 2019 | While living in California for the first time and briefly (in a remote capacity) after moving to Seattle, I worked for a company called Edventure More, or EDMO. In the summers I served as a full-time instructor at their educational youth camps. During the rest of the year I worked part time, discharging marketing duties and instructing for community events and after-school programs. During the school years in this period I also worked sporadically as a substitute teacher for the Cupertino Union School District. |
| Dec. 2017 to Dec. 2018 | After moving to California, I volunteered for a year as a [court appointed special advocate, or CASA, in Santa Clara County, CA](https://childadvocatessv.org/). In this role I was matched with kids who were involved with the Santa Clara County foster care system, and served them as a mentor and advocate.
| Nov. 2014 to June 2016 | After college I worked as an in-home caregiver for a Pittsburgh company called Advanced Living Options, or ALO. In my role, I supported and managed care for individuals with mental and physical disabilities. I grew up very closely with a family member with severe special needs, which helped to prepare me for this position. Even so, this was very intense work, and it added a lot to my knowledge and competence with navigating systemic and individual-level challenges, government support programs, and bureaucratic regulations. |
| April 2014 to July 2014 | I worked for one summer as a marketing intern with a Pittsburgh property management company called Mozart Management. It was fairly simple website management work and advertisement upkeep. |
| Jan. 2014 to April 2014 | I briefly worked as a STEM coordinator with a Pittsburgh nonprofit called Neighborhood Learning Alliance, or NLA. In this position, I gained experience designing and implementing programs, cultivating client and partner relationships, and applying for grants. |
| Dec. 2012 to Feb. 2014 | After the particle detector project concluded, I worked as a nanny and tutor for College Nannies & Tutors of North Pittsburgh. I traveled to people's homes to teach standardized test prep, STEM subjects, and some German, or to provide childcare for younger children. |
| April 2011 to Aug. 2012 | Later in my college career I worked as a lab technician with the CMU Medium Energy Physics Department. I worked in a clean room on a small team, building a 12 GeV particle detector which was eventually installed in [Hall D of Jefferson Lab](https://www.jlab.org/Hall-D/). |
| Sep. 2009 to May 2011 | For the first few years of college, I worked as customer service associate or "desk service attendant" for CMU Resident Services. I crewed the desks at the entrances of residence halls, checking in guests and answering questions. |
| Sep. 2009 to May 2014 | I attended [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/) for my undergraduate education. I spent the first few years pursuing dual degrees in physics and international relations & politics; however, after working in a lab and realizing that the day-to-day reality of work with a B.S. in physics was not what I wanted to do indefinitely, I decided to content myself with what I already had completed in the physics track (more than a minor but less than a major) and just wrap up my B.S. in international relations & politics. |
| May to Sep. 2009 and 2010 | For two summers-- following my high school graduation and my freshman year of college-- I worked full time as a secretary at the highschool in my hometown. The position was actually part of a suite of poverty-alleviation efforts for young people from low-income families; it paid slightly above minimum wage and included some career development support. |
| Dec. 2008 to May 2009 | Soon after getting my driver's license when I was 16, I got my first job as a cashier at the McDonald's in a neighboring town. My managers had me do front-facing work for 100% of my hours, due to my knack for customer service. |
