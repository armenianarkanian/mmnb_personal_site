Hello! I’m a well-rounded policy professional seeking employment as a policy analyst in an organization that is focused on improving equity. I am a versatile employee who can competently juggle research, analysis, writing, communication, project management, and event organization. My lived experiences in poverty drive my passion for policy improvement, especially systemic reform, and I’m eager to serve as part of a team working on challenging, progressive initiatives.
