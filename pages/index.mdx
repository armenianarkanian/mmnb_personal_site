Hello! 

I'm a well-rounded policy professional seeking to collaboratively engage in intersectional,
systems-level work to improve the world. I'm most passionate about poverty policy, including labor
policy, welfare policy, and disability policy.

Over the course of my 15-year employment history, I have grown in competence and learned much about how to
be a mindful, efficacious, and supportive team member.
While my past employment was motivated by my need to make ends meet and was largely in the fields of education and customer
service, I'm now looking to follow my passion and transition into a career that utilizes my strengths.
