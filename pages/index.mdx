Hello! Iâ€™m a well-rounded policy professional seeking employment as a public policy research analyst, ideally in work that intersects with or is closely related to poverty policy, such as:
-Research on wealth inequality or economic (dis)enfranchisement
-Program evaluation relating to workforce development initiatives
-Investigation of the strengths and weaknesses of communal public institutions 
-Research in the traditional fields of Medicaid, labor laws, disability policy, tax policy, etc.
-Tracking of refugee and asylum seeker support initiatives
-Measurement of equitable access to healthcare and public education resources

While I'm very organized and people-oriented in ways that would serve me well as a program manager and am analytically-minded and detail-oriented in ways that lend themselves well to becoming a successful finance specialist, I am most enthusiastic about research. I would love to spend my days collecting, organizing and analyzing data/information, then synthesizing conclusions and preparing them to be presented to people who can use them.
