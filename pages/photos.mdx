# Professional Experience

Having been working nearly continuously since I was 16 years old, [I have a long history of experience
with showing up, getting shit done, and being a mindful and supportive coworker.] While my past employment
was [to make enough money to live] and was largely in the fields of education and customer service, I'm now
looking to transition into a career that I'm passionate about.

| Currently | I currently work as a part-time remote college prep tutor with an excellent independent tutoring company in
Seattle, called [University Tutoring](https://www.universitytutoring.com/).
I've been working with University Tutoring since February of 2019 (except during the height of the pandemic),
and I deeply enjoy the puzzle of how to best convey concepts and information to learners.|
| Summer 2022 | My most recent policy work was a passion project of mine. In the summer of 2022 I was able to carry out an independent study wherein I designed and executed research and [wrote a report]() on the poverty challenges which face my home county. The report explores the intersecting web of challenges which fuel each other and effect a state of extremely limited economic mobility in this area of Northern Appalachia.|

For six months in my final year of my master's degree program, I worked with a team of three other MPA
(master's of public administration) students to carry out policy analysis research and write a white paper
for the Washington State Department of Health (DOH). Focused specifically on [the DOH's upcoming work to
designate and implement Health Equity Zones (HEZ)](https://doh.wa.gov/community-and-environment/health-equity/health-equity-zones),
[our report]() includes background information, data analysis based on Washington's community health
assessments, and a breakdown of other HEZ which have been implemented in the U.S.

From fall 2020 to summer 2022, I was an MPA (master's of public administration) candidate at the [University
of Washington Evans School of Public policy & Governance](https://evans.uw.edu/). The Evans School works to
provide students with a well-rounded education in quantitative and qualitative policy and administration fields,
including: _public finance; data analysis; management; organizational performance; economics; policy analysis;
and program evaluation._ During my time in the program I also studied: _leadership; behavioral economics;
qualitative research methodology; U.S. poverty policy; and Arabic language and culture._
[My unofficial transcripts can be viewed here.]()

I completed twelve months of service as an AmeriCorps VISTA, working to build the capacity of [a Seattle
nonprofit school for English language learners called Literacy Source](https://www.literacysource.org/).
During this time I honed my project management skills. . .
